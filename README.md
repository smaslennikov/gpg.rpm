# My Packages [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/smaslennikov/packages.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/smaslennikov/packages)

This repo contains CentOS packages I frequently need that aren't supplied by EPEL or base repositories.

Ubuntu packages could also be built, but Travis only supports 16.04, while 18.04 has extremely different `provides` requirements. I give up on this.

## Binaries

...are to be found under [Releases](https://github.com/smaslennikov/packages/releases).

## Usage

Follow instructions [in the INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md).

## Testing procedure

I use GPG on a regular basis and primarily use CentOS. Whatever issues arise will be fixed as they're introduced.

## Contributions

...are always welcome!
